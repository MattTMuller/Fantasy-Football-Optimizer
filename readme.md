# Fantasy Football Champion

## Mission Statement:
To develop a program that will analytically predict players to choose in the game Fantasy Football, optimizing for points and be able to dynamically change in accordance with changes in the game.

## Project Overview:
Learn how fantasy football is played :P 
See what free data is out there
Scrape or use API to get the data (API looks to be mostly pay to use)
Do data inspection (perhaps upload the data to Kaggle to see what people do with it there)
Develop system, whether that be a sort algorithm or AI algorithm to optimize for player choice



## Fantasy Football Rules:
### _For standard league_:
_Choose Players_:
Start with one quarterback
Two running backs
One flex player (running back or wide receiver)
One tight end
One team defense/special teams (the entire defense and special teams for a given team
A kicker
Then:
You are given seven bench spots.

_Scoring_
Scoring guidelines vary depending on the rules
Players are picked or recruited by either Snake (like Settlers of Catan) or Auction where players are bid for. 

## Goal:
Develop system, whether that be a sort algorithm or AI algorithm to optimize for player choice
For an AI approach, I have the AI play against itself using previous years as testing, and train the weight that it gives different rankings.
